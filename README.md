## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)

### What I learned

This was my first time using Astro, and I really enjoyed it. I also learned how to use Leaflet without helper libraries like React-Leaflet.

### Continued development

I'll keep using astro for websites that don't require a lot of dynamic content, probably try out astro with different frameworks like Solid.JS and Svelte.
